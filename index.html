          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <div id="poverty"> 
            <h5> Correlations between Poverty % and Health Risks</h5>
            The median age of the population studied across 51 states range from 30.5 years to 44.1 years. Studying the effects of Poverty % to 
            the lack of healthcare , smoking % and the obesity %  we infer the following:
            <ul>
            <li>There is a positive correlation between the poverty percentage and lack of healthcare. The calculated correlation coefficient is 0.52 </li>
            <li>There is a positive correlation between poverty percentage and number of smokers. The calcualted correlation coefficient is 0.52</li>
            <li>There is a positive correlation between poverty percentage and Obesity percentage. The calculated correlation coefficient is 0.46</li>
            </ul>

          <div id="age">
              <h5> Correlations between Age and Health Risks</h5>
            The median age of the population studied across 51 states range from 30.5 years to 44.1 years. Studying the effects of median age to 
              the lack of healthcare , smoking % and the obesity %  we infer the following,but since we have the median age the results may not be accurate and may be skewed.
              <ul>
              <li>There is a negative correlation between the Median Age  and lack of healthcare. As people age the number of people having healthcare coverage increases.
                  The calculated correlation coefficient is -0.38522
              </li>
              <li>There is a weak positive correlation between age and number of smokers.The calculated correlation coefficient is 0.248</li>
              <li>There is a negative  correlation between age and Obesity percentage.The calcualted correlation coefficient is -0.00769.</li> </ul></div>

          <div id="income">
              <h5> Correlations between Median income and Health Risks</h5>
            The median age of the population studied across 51 states range from 30.5 years to 44.1 years. Studying the effects of median income to 
              the lack of healthcare , smoking % and the obesity %  we infer the following:
              <ul>
              <li>There is a negative correlation between the Median income and lack of healthcare. As the income increases lack of healthcare coverage decreases.The calculated correlation
                coefficient is -0.434
              </li>
              <li>There is a negative correlation between median income and number of smokers. The calcualted correlation coefficient is -0.66</li>
              <li>There is a negative  correlation between median income and Obesity percentage.The calculated correlation coefficient is -0.65</li>
